        Fixed problems in test-suite that seemed to be an artefact of some more
        recent changes in Test::More and/or perl 5.16.0.  I hope I didn't
        shuffle a deeper lying issue under the carpet.

        Raised dependency on Data::Alias to 1.16.  Some simplifications in the
        test-suite.  Verified it works with 5.16.0, both threaded and
        unthreaded.

        Added license information as parameter.  Verified it works with

0.08    31 March 2012
        Some minor documentation fixes.  Verified it's working with 5.14.2,
        both threaded and unthreaded.

        Fix creation of internal keys for UTF-8 encoded strings.

0.05    23 August 2006
        Some tweaks in "reuse" for better performance.

        Added subroutine "fixate" for easily initializing hashes and list,
        and to easily fixate already filled hashes and lists.

        Added subroutine "spread" for easily spreading the same constant
        value in a hash or a list.

        Added subroutine "forget" for resetting the internal hash for keeping
        constant values.

        Removed TODO file, please check TODO section in the pod.
